      `Robot Framework is a generic open source automation framework.
      It can be used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).<br><br>

      Robot Framework is actively supported, with many industry-leading companies using
      it in their software development.<br><br>

      Robot Framework is open and extensible and can be integrated with virtually any
      other tool to create powerful and flexible automation solutions. Being open source
      also means that Robot Framework is free to use without licensing costs. Robot Framework
      has easy syntax, utilizing human-readable keywords. Its capabilities can be extended
      by libraries implemented with Python or Java. The framework has a rich ecosystem
      around it, consisting of libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects.`,
