      `Robot Framework is a generic open source automation framework.
      It can be used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).<br><br>

      Robot Framework is actively supported, with many industry-leading companies using it in their software development.<br><br>

      Robot Framework is open and extensible and can be integrated with virtually any other tool to create powerful and flexible automation solutions.
      Being open source also means that Robot Framework is free to use without licensing costs.
      Robot Framework has easy syntax, utilizing human-readable keywords. Its capabilities can be extended by libraries implemented with Python or Java.
      The framework has a rich ecosystem around it, consisting of libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects.`,

      Robot Framework project is hosted on GitHub where you can find further documentation, source code, and issue tracker. Downloads are hosted at PyPI.<br<br>

      Robot Framework is operating system and application independent.
      The core framework is implemented using Python and also runs on Jython (JVM) and IronPython (.NET).<br><br>

      Robot Framework itself is open source software released under Apache License 2.0, and most of the libraries and tools in the ecosystem are also open source.
      The framework was initially developed at Nokia Networks and was open sourced in 2008.`
